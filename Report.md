## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    Allows computers to identify other devices over LAN or other networks

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    Domain Service Name. A nickname for the IP address that is easier to remember

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static does not change, while dynamic is given everytime a device connects to the network

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    UDP provides unreliable communication, but faster than the more reliable TCP protocols

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    It is event based, so a delay call will mess up timing in the program

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    Nothing else can be running while the blocking function is running

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Other things might need to be running while non-blocking code is being executed

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Implementation is a version of a design, interface is the specific use of an implementation
